# RCDP Barriers
Data for publication "High-throughput computational analysis of kinetic barriers to ring-closing depolymerization for aliphatic polycarbonates"

## DFTB
DFTB calculated barriers for 50 polycarbonates
- SMILES: the SMILES string of the ring form of the carbonate monomer
- compound: the reference number as referred to in the paper
- DFTB_barrier: barrier in kcal/mol, by the methods described in the paper
- solvent_name: solvent which was used implicitly in calculations
- solvent-interaction: solvent interaction energy output by the DFTB calculation, in kcal/mol
- volume: volume of the molecule as output by the DFTB calculation, in Angstroms^3
 
## DFT
